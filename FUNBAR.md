Bob and Carol are pair-programming one feature in FUBAR.md on Carol's laptop in a new feature branch
Bob and Carol are creating a clock feature for the project. They ACP from branch then do a pull request.
and had the project over to Ted & Alice review the feature, approve that it is good and subsequently merge it.
Ted & Alice then do a git pull origin main into their feature branch (non main feature branch) on Tedâ€™s laptop ONLY and continue working on that feature.

Ted and Alice continue their feature on their branch non main feature branch 

Bob and Carol start a new feature on Bob's computer now but forgot to do a git pull origin main with caused a merge conflit with Alice and Ted.
