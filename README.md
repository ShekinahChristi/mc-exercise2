# mc-exercise How could these problems have been prevented?

Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo.

All team members messed up because they were all working on same feature rather then working on different files which would of pervented merge conflicts.... 
I feel like both teams were not communicating very well which also would of prevented lots of mistakes. Each individual should of 
been working on their own computer and keeping the code updated as they went all. 
Then Bob would not have forgotten to do the pull origin main which caused the first merge conflict. 



# What did I learn on this project?
MC-Exercise was the final project for class 201 it taught us how to create an organization when collaborating with a team. 
This exercise showed me how to name the team and add contact information for viewers or other developers to contact the team. 
It also teaches how to avoid merge conflicts and how to fix them if they do occur during a project. 
This is something I used in final team project and will continue to use in the future as I continue my career as a software developer.
